# Limit Displayed List Items by Breakpoint

## Description

This CSS snippet allows you to control the number of items displayed in a list (e.g., a Webflow Collection List, blog post feed, product grid) based on the screen width. It's particularly useful for showing fewer items on smaller screens (mobile/tablet) to improve layout and user experience, while showing all or more items on larger screens.

## Code

```html
<style>
  /*
    Limit items displayed in a list on smaller screens.
    Example: Show only the first 3 items on screens 991px wide or less.
  */
  @media screen and (max-width: 991px) {
    .your-collection-list-wrapper .your-collection-item:nth-child(n+4) {
      display: none;
    }
  }
</style>
