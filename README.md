# Webflow-Boiler ðŸš€

A collection of handy code snippets for Webflow projects.
These snippets are designed to be easily copied and pasted into Webflow's custom code sections.

## Table of Contents

### CSS Snippets
*   [Limit Displayed List Items by Breakpoint](./css-snippets/limit-items-by-breakpoint.md)
*   *[Add new CSS snippets here]*

    ### JavaScript Snippets
    *   *[Add new JS snippets here]*

    ### Integrations
    *   *[Add new integration snippets here]*

    ## How to Use
    1. Browse the Table of Contents or navigate the folders.
    2. Click on a snippet to view its details.
    3. Follow the instructions within the snippet's `.md` file to implement it in your Webflow project.

    ## Contributing (to my own repo)
    1. Create a new `.md` file in the relevant category folder (e.g., `css-snippets/`).
    2. Follow the established format for snippet documentation.
    3. Add a link to the new snippet in this `README.md`'s Table of Contents.
    4. Commit and push changes.

6.  **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .  # Stages all new and modified files
    git commit -m "Add: CSS snippet for limiting items by breakpoint"
    git push origin main # Or your default branch name (e.g., master)
    ```

**For Future Snippets:**

1.  Decide on the category (CSS, JS, etc.).
2.  Create a new `.md` file in that category's folder (e.g., `js-snippets/my-new-script.md`).
3.  Write the content for the snippet in the `.md` file using the established format.
4.  Add a link to the new snippet in the main `README.md`'s Table of Contents.
5.  `git add .`
6.  `git commit -m "Add: [Brief description of snippet]"`
7.  `git push origin main`
